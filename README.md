## Design

### Font

In order to get a nice feel and complementary fonts I used Poppins from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) in order to select the best fonts I felt for the page. Using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Colors

Using the current color set of the bar, I chose a color pallete using [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)

- Primary color - #18280D
- Secondary color - #7c3626
- Accent primary color - #f5853f
- Secondary accent color - #f7f3e3

### Icons

Using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) I seleceted the social media icons and embedded them into the footer element

### Structure

Based on current user experiences, I am choosing to go with a Mobile first approach. I am trying to avoid any scrolling to keep the app in a single container page.

I am choosing JS to help create the page based on user interaction and hide/show elements seemlessly as needed.

## Wireframes

Using Figma I have created initially the mobile first look and feel then scaled based on larger screen requirements
